# Employee Management System

## Introduction

  The Employee Management System is a simple Java application that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It allows managing employee records by storing and displaying their details.

## Features

  Define an Employee class with attributes:

    id (Integer)

    name (String)

    salary (Double)

    Implement a method displayDetails() to print employee details.

    Create and store multiple employee objects in a list.

    Display employee details using iteration.

         cd Employee_Management_System
 
   2. **Compile the Java program:**

  ## Key OOP Concepts Used
  ✅ Encapsulation: Private fields (id, name, salary) with a constructor to initialize them.
  ✅ Abstraction: displayDetails() method hides implementation details and provides a clean interface.
  ✅ Polymorphism: Not used in this simple example, but can be added (e.g., subclasses for different employee types).
  ✅ Inheritance: Not used but can be extended (e.g., Manager class inheriting from Employee).
